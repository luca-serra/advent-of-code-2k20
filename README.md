# Advent of Code 2020

This repository contains my personal solutions for the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020), written in Python. 

## Requirements

No specific packages are required to run the code.

## Usage

To execute the code of a given day number *n*, please reproduce the following steps:

1. Go to the [`data`](https://github.com/luca-serra/advent-of-code-2k20/tree/main/data) folder to get the necessary data and follow the instructions.

2. Execute the following command: `cd code/day_n && python day_n.py`.

The solution to the problem will be printed in your console.
